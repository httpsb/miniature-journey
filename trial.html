        <h2>the seat behind the driver's seat</h2>
        <p>There is this thing about choosing to study abroad. Mine was because when I was finishing my SPM in 2020, the world was facing the COVID-19 pandemic and politically my country was an absolute mess. Schools were messed up, and safety measures were too and I got really frustrated by the people with the power to make decisions for the country at that time. While cramming for my examinations I had this thought that I really wanted to go far away from here. I really wanted to move abroad.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to today, it's been about 9 months since I left home to follow this dream of mine.</p>

        <p>The first few months were fascinating to me. The fact that I now live in a country with an efficient public transportation system, smart disaster management, a walkable city, interesting cafes, and the list goes on. I am definitely living a better life here, even though I have not yet figured out everything yet.</p>

        <p>I realized that I left home in exchange for something better.</p>

        <p>I like winter and when it gets warmer the flowers start to bloom<br>
        Cherry blossoms,<br>
        Azaleas,<br>
        Roses,<br>
        Wildflowers,<br>
        And soon the leaves will turn orange again.</p>

        <p>Empty bus rides around Seoul when it was raining made me ponder<br>
        And I realized,</p>

        <p><b>I didn't leave Malaysia because I hated it.</b></p>

        <p>And the thing about moving abroad is it teaches you to appreciate both; what you used to have and what you have now.</p>

        <p>I left the comfort of driving a car in exchange for an efficient public transportation system.<br>
        I left the comfort of Malaysian food in exchange for a bowl of <em>tteokbokki</em>.<br>
        I left the comfort of having my family around to help, in exchange for independence and self-discovery.<br>
        I left the comfort of living in a big house, in exchange for the calmness of having a river stream in my neighbourhood.</p>

        <p>I now get to enjoy Korean food almost every day but I still miss <em>nasi lemak</em> at home.<br>
        I get to buy <em>kkwabaegi</em> in the evenings after school but I miss coming home to <em>pisang goreng</em>.<br>
        I can understand Korean but these people here have no idea how funny I am in my own language.<br>
        I get to cycle around Han River but it must be better if I get to do it with my father.</p>

        <p>It is not that I hated my country, it was the fact that <b>I wanted to embrace change</b>.</p>

        <p>And if you ask me which seat is the best on an empty bus,</p>

        <p>It is the seat behind the driver’s seat.</p>

        <h2>Another Reflection</h2>
        <p>This is a new reflection. It's all about how small moments can lead to big realizations. I love writing down my thoughts and seeing them grow into something meaningful.</p>
